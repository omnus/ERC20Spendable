 * @notice ERC20 extension to allow ERC20s to operate as 'spendable' items, i.e. an ERC20 token that
 * can trigger an action on another contract at the same time as being transfered. Similar to ERC677
 * and the hooks in ERC777, but with more of an empasis on interoperability (returned values) than
 * ERC677 and specifically scoped interaction rather than the general hooks of ERC777.
 *
 * Interface for custom error definitions
